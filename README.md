Developing my first JavaScript app following scrimba and Flatiron school.

Very simple counter app that help to reinforced what I have learned and currently learning from Flatiron school in combination with challenges via Scrimba.

This simple counting app:
fundamental HTML & CSS
JavaScript functions

Manipuilating the DOM
Renddering variables in index.html
and mush more.


Update:
Redesigned

Added save button and function

Roadmap:
